# Vigenere Cipher

This is a simple console application that can encode/decode a string using the Vigenere Cipher and a given key. 

If there are any spaces or non-alphabetic characters in the plain text, these will be removed.

The plain text and key will be converted to uppercase. 

If the key is shorter than the plain/cipher text, the key will be looped.
